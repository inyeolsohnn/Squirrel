A message is an item that is sent between the server and the client (the client requests and the server responds, e.g.) by using a webservice (in this case). To standardize the format in which the messages are sent back and forth, every message must derive from respective base class.\r\n\r\nThe concrete implementation of a specific message then contains the properties that reflect its own actual meaning. \r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n- Chris"
