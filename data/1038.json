  "ques": "It took me a while to find this out.  To avoid you from having to chase for the same information: here\u0027s how you extract key / value pairs from the FormCollection that comes as an argument in an ASP.NET MVC action method:\r\n\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult Create(FormCollection formCollection)\r\n{\r\n\r\n   foreach (var key in formCollection.AllKeys)\r\n   {\r\n      var value \u003d formCollection[key];\r\n      // etc.\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   foreach (var key in formCollection.Keys)\r\n   {\r\n       var value \u003d formCollection[key.ToString()];\r\n       // etc.\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nAlso, a final tip: If you find that the formCollection does not contain the key/value pairs you expected, check that \r\n\r\nYour controls reside within the correct form (you can have more than one)\r\nYour controls have names (just having an id is not returning values in the formCollection)Hope this helps.
