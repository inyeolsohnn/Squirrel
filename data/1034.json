In today\u0027s environment there are application that need to integrate with different sites such as netflix, facebook, twitter, etc to provide better user experience and create new scenarios. MS has come up with OData protocol which is becoming standard across many sites. I would like to see what patterns need to be followed to build such app which can show the power of integration with multiple sites. \r\n\r\nAnother item I wanted to add into the list was \u0027Windows Phone 7\u0027 UI. \r\n\r\nLooking forward for the next release. \r\n\r\nRegards \r\nSanjay Singh"
