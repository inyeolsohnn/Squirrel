And then when you want to deploy it you would change the  \u0027localhost \u0027 to an IP or domain name.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is more involved than that, but that\u0027s the general idea.  You would really have to read the documentation (from various sources on the web) on the best method for your purpose.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\nKing Wilder"
