When you have slow service operations which could causes timeouts to occur the request will be aborted and you will find an entry in the ASP.NET EventLog that informs you that the request has timed out.\r\n\u003cconfiguration\u003e\r\n  \u003csystem.web\u003e\r\n  \u003chttpRuntime executionTimeout\u003d \u0027600 \u0027/\u003e\r\n  \u003c/system.web\u003e\r\n\u003c/configuration\u003e\r\nNote that 600 is 10 minutes.\r\nThen remember that if IIS is hosting the WCF Service there are timeout settings which need to be managed there as well.\r\nThis is certainly not all there is to know about TimeOut settings but I hope this points you in the right direction.\r\nGood luck Emily\r\n\r\nRicky"
