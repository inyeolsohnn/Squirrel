  "ques": "We are looking into moving our web app to Web 2.0, i.e. lots of interactivity with Ajax.  It seems that Microsoft is supporting two separate libraries ASP.NET AJAX and jQuery.  Why would I use one over the other?  \r\n\r\nBTW: to reduce page sizes, we are looking to standardize on just one of these options.\r\n",

ASP.NET AJAX is to reduce visible server post-back and less of DOM-based UI manipulation. I strongly suggest to go with both because both combinely give lot of power."
