  "ques": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI\u0027m stepping through code in Patterns in Action and if I pause too long (or am interrupted) I get the following time-out message:\r\n\r\nSystem.TimeoutException was unhandled by user code. Message\u003d\u0027The request channel timed out while waiting for a reply after 00:00:00. Increase the timeout value passed to the call to Request or increase the SendTimeout value on the Binding. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.\u0027\r\n\r\nIf I attempt to run the code again without first stopping \u0026 restarting the solution, the ServiceChannel is in a Faulted state and cannot be used.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve looked through the PDF but don\u0027t see where I can adjust the time-out.  I adjusted the receiveTimeout of the wsHttpBinding section in the Hosting Layer\u0027s ActionServer\u0027s web.config, but that didn\u0027t change things. Any ideas on adjusting this so I can pause while stepping through code?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKelley ",
