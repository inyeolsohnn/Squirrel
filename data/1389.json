I would like to see how you suggest create the order and orderitems an how and where you update the Product.UnitsInStock.\r\n\r\nI do like your product but i think that is need that the checkout would be implemented.\r\n\r\nexcuse my bad english.\r\nthanks.",

      "ans": "Yes you are right .\r\n\r\nHowever i think that the use cases already implemented has basic CRUD operations. I think that the checkout use case (not ask card info), i.e. place the order is a more complex use case that allow show a transaction script pattern or the application service pattern or domain Model pattern, i.e. i have doubts about where I should be put my complex business rules in a use case.\r\n\r\nthanks in advanced."
