      "ans": "Hello Akbar: \r\n\r\nThe Design Pattern Framework is a combination of e-books (pdf documents), .NET Solutions (lot\u0027s of source code), and diagrams.  They are installed as a package, including menu shortcuts, on each individual user\u0027s machine.  It requires Visual Studio 2010 (Professional or better).\r\n\r\nThe 16 user license is actually quite simple. You can have up to 16 users (named users, not concurrent users) install it on their machines. Each user is allowed to install a copy on their local machine and possibly home machine, as long as he/she is the only user.  \r\n\r\nThe Design Pattern Framework package is not designed to be shared on a on a network or intranet share, primarily because these are .NET Solutions / Projects that are viewed, explored, and run locally.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.
