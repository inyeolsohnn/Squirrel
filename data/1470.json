      "ans": "Do as Dan suggests and also add your own _layout.cshtml file.  If you have different Areas that will display content differently, it\u0027s good to have one _layout.cshtml for each Area.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are using VS 2010, you should definitely make sure you are using the latest Tools Update for Visual Studio.  This changes the  \u0027Add \u0027 dialogs to include many new features including HTML5 stuff.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."
