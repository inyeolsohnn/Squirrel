  "ques": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a question on data access.  Why are DAOs (Data Access Objects) used to run queries against the database?  I thought that this was the job of the Repository?\r\n\r\nI am going through the Design Pattern Framework\u0027s MVC application.  The controller calls the Repository and the Repository calls the Service.  Then in the service a Data Access Objects are called to retrieve data  Why is it done this way?\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?  Why is there a Repository Pattern?\r\n\r\nAny comments would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
