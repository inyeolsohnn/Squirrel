  "ques": "My team is starting early next year on a large Windows Azure project for which I will be the Architect. As an architect, I have found the Design Pattern Framework 4.0 to be extremely helpful, but unfortunately it does not (yet) include Azure patterns and practices.\r\n\r\nMy questions is this: does anyone know where/how to obtain patterns and best practices for Azure?  I am particularly interested in Communication and Storage patterns -- also, I would like to see real world experiences and examples.  \r\n\r\nI know this is a lot to ask, but I thought I try :-)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",

It\u0027s very early at this point so I cannot give an ETA or anything right now.\r\n\r\nAll the best with your Azure project.\r\nLet us know how it goes!\r\n\r\nDan."
