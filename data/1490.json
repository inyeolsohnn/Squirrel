  "ques": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe are very interested in your product and we intend to start designing out software using Design Patterns.\r\nWe are planning to buy the Design Pattern Framework, but we would like to know if there is an evaluation version available, \r\nso we can better assess what we can use...\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert van Drie\r\nSenior Software Engineer",

      "ans": "Hello Robert: \r\n\r\nThe Design Pattern Framework comes with 100% source code, which is why we cannot offer an evaluation version.  \r\nHowever, we do offer a full 60-day money back guarantee, so there is really no risk.  \r\n\r\nDan"

      "ans": "Robert, the price for the DoFactory Framework is more than worthy for what you get. \r\n\r\nBuy one single license first and then take a look, I\u0027ve been using it for many years and it helped me a lot. It is great for learning as well as useful for ideas and solutions for real world problems and projects."
