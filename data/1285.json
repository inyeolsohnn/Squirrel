Yes, it is a difficult read.\r\n\r\nI have not read the Heads First book, the one referenced in the DoFactory Framework, but I would recommend it simply because others have recommended it, and you have C# code to walk through as you read.  There is however, plenty of stuff on the web that talks about design patters, but I ended up here because DoFactory gave me code to go along with the \u0027talk\u0027.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend Code Complete.\r\n\r\n-Mike"

It also has applications of patterns in the .NET framework and some real examples as well.\r\n\r\nGOF is a good book and at first read it may seem difficult but once you come back to it after reading the above or Head First, you will be able to make most of the GOF book..."
