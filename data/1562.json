  "ques": "We all know that Builder Pattern is one of the creational patterns and Composite Pattern is one of the structural patterns .\r\nMy question is, can I create a menu like a Command menu or menutoolbar with two of these Patterns? \r\nWhat are their critical differences?  Or, which is better to create a menu toolbar?\r\n\r\nBest Regards.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

      "ans": "Hi,\r\n\r\nYou should use Composite Pattern as your menu items will be dynamic. \r\nComposite creates Parent - Child relations between your objects while Builder is used to create group of objects of predefined types.\r\n\r\nSo i would suggest you to use Composite to create your menu items.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAnkit Parikh"
