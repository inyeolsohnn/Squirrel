  "ques": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am developing a Windows Form application to screen scrape a complex web application that has Ajax in its pages.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the web app has multiple pages and I need to navigate \u0026 perform click operation many times to get the appropriate page data. \r\nI am thinking about a Design Pattern to implement this. Can anyone guide as to which Pattern or Patterns would be suitable for this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNeetha ",
