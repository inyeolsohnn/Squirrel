  "ques": "Hi all, I am doing a project (Win Forms Application) in .NET 4.0. \r\nFor Data Access I am using Entity Framework.\r\n \r\nTo query the objects do I need a wrapper class like Business Layer or can I directly use the entities in the UI?\r\nJust in general, when do I use the Business Lyer. Anyhow, I am a bit confused as my previous experience is with 3-tier architectures and I am feeling that with Entity Framework this is difficult to achieve.",
