I suspect it is related to having both SQL Express 2005 and SQL Express 2008 installed. \r\n\r\nI did some Googling and Binging around and these are some similar threads that may include a solution for you: \r\n\r\nhttp://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/sqlexpress/thread/43dea830-21ed-42fe-a89c-129c753cf120/\r\nand \r\nhttp://conceptdev.blogspot.com/2009/04/mdf-cannot-be-opened-because-it-is.html\r\n\r\nI hope this points you in the right direction."
