To maximize the learning experience we\u0027ve tried to keep things as simple (and yet complete) as possible, which is why there is a minimum of external 3rd-party dependencies (Moq being the only exception). \r\n\r\nI am not an NHibernate expert, but for what it is worth, I read an article today where it was stated that with the latest release of Entity Framework 4 it is ready to take on NHibernate:\r\nhttp://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2010/09/01/Get-Ready-for-the-Entity-Framework.aspx\r\n\r\nAgain sorry. If the inclusion of NHibernate was critical to you, remember that we offer a 60-day money back guarantee.\r\n\r\nDan."
