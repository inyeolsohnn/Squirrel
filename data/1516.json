      "ans": "Yes, a very valid point. After some reflection I can now see that fields and properties are able to be serialized. I guess the only other reason to use properties is because properties are bindable and fields (variables) are not. Added to that if you use reflection to reference these things then I think the behaviour is slightly different.\r\n\r\nI always thought that fields were not serializable.... I now know they are so that is good!"
