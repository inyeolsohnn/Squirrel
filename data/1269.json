  "ques": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re developing an ASP.NET 4 application using the MVP pattern. \r\nOn many pages we call WCF services which return data for ASP.NET controls like DropDownList and so on.\r\nWe have put WCF in a separate project (which is hosted in IIS)\r\n\r\nMy question is this: How to build communication between jQuery and WCF so that we can databind the data returned from WCF?\r\nThanks in advance for detailed answer!
