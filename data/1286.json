  "ques": "The dynamic keyword is a recent addition to the C# language.  I have a gut feel that one or more of the GOF and/or MVC/MVP/MVVM patterns could benefit from its use. \r\n\r\nHas anyone found a great use of dynamic in any of their own Design Pattern implementations?\r\n(I am looking for this nice little \u0027gem\u0027 :-) )\r\n\r\nThanks.",

In fact, this is one of the cool language features that may have many applications which may not have been explored yet because of the static nature of c#.  But dynamic will change that.  Once caveat would be dynamic has a cost and its proper usage should always be evaluated.\r\n\r\nhttp://code.logos.com/blog/2010/03/the_visitor_pattern_and_dynamic_in_c_4.html\r\n\r\nHope you find this useful."
