This includes: code (design and architecture), comments, documentation, references, installation program, our website, etc. etc.  It may not seem like much, but getting a new release out using 3 additional platforms (MVC, Silverlight, Entity Framework) and more, is a pretty major effort. \r\n\r\nEveryone reading this is a developer, so I am sure you understand. :-) \r\n\r\nThe best I can say is a \u0027small number\u0027 of weeks. \r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n"
