      "ans": "Hello Francesco:\r\n\r\nYour Design Pattern Framework 4.0 purchase includes older versions of the Framework as well.  These include versions for .NET 3.5, .NET 2.0, and .NET 1.1.\r\n\r\nOf course, the more recent versions are \u0027richer\u0027 and have more functionality, simpley because .NET is richer.  But the fundamentals of what Design Patterns are and how they are used has not changed -- in fact, Design Patterns already existed before .NET.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\nDan."
