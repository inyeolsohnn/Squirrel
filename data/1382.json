Do you see any error or other message?\r\n\r\nJust to be sure, the credentials for all applications are: username debbie and password secret123. \r\nThe databases (action and membership) used in the Silverlight app have the exact same content as the Patterns in Action solution.\r\nThey reside under the App_Data folder.\r\n\r\nAt this point my best suggestion would be to set a debugger breakpoint in the login page, then step through and see where it fails. \r\nHopefully, this gets you going.\r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n"
