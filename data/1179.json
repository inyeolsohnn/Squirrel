  "ques": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am working on a maintenance project and I see at lot of places the application logic is written in if..else if..else conditions.\r\n\r\nMany times the if conditions check the value of a variable against a hard-coded string/number. I think there is something wrong with the code and it needs to be improved.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please suggest whether I should change such code with any specific pattern?\r\nAlso, it would be helpful if someone could share an example/link that shows sample conversion code.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
