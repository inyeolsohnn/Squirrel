  "ques": "So here is a question. \r\n\r\nSay, you\u0027re designing an app that ultimately runs on ASP.NET MVC, Winforms, WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone.  You need to store application settings, such as connection strings, app configuration settings, user preferences (ideally encrypted), in all these platforms and wish to avoid duplicate code.\r\n\r\nIs there such a thing as a \u0027Universal\u0027 or common place to store application settings?  I think I know most of the options: registry, xml file, Application.Settings, etc, but what ties the different .NET platforms together?\r\n",
