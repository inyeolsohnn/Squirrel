I have no idea why the install is doing that.  We redirect My Documents to the M: Drive, it may have something to do with that.  That?s not something I can adjust as It?s governed by group policy.  Were previous installations in Windows 7 environment?   \r\nIs there some command line install to get around this?  \r\nIs the install trying to write to my local C: drive MyDocuments (which is being (mis)directed to a shared network drive?\r\n",

It has been discussed in this thread: \r\nhttp://www.dofactory.com/topic/1134/how-do-you-change-the-default-installation-folder-for-the-c-version-of-dp.aspx.  \r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, the error is caused by a registry mis-configuration on your computer. \r\nEven Microsoft\u0027s own products (like Office) cannot be installed when this occurs. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft offers a \u0027FixIt\u0027 utility that you may want to try. \r\nYou\u0027ll find it here. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/886549\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
