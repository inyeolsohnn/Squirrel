  "ques": "One of our clients wants us to evaluate the best option: move to Entity Framework 4.0 or LINQ-to-SQL (for when Visual Studio 2010 is out). We have some experience with LINQ-to-SQL, which we really like, but virtually no experience with the Entity Framework.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our projects use LINQ-to-SQL in production and they are running fine. So, what are the advantages of moving to EF 4.0?  I am particularly concerned about EF performance in situations where the database schema and the SQL queries are generated by EF (from a Domain Model). I just don\u0027t know how performant this is.\r\n\r\nAny experiences would be much appreciated.",
