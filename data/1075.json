      "ans": "In the USA I took a class on OOP and UML.  We covered 4 design patterns in the class and the instructor suggested additional study on GoF patterns.  If there had been a more in depth class on them I would have taken it.  The OOP class was a requirement before taking C++, C#, or Java classes.  At the time C# was still in beta, but the college was teaching it anyway.  I was not a computer science major, just took the classes to fill electives because I was interested.\r\n\r\nI wish there was more about patterns taught in college as they are an excellent way to properly apply other things learned in computer science classes."
