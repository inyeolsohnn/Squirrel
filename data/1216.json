There was no reply because from your email we gathered that you seem to extract great pleasure in pointing out other developer\u0027s \u0027flaws\u0027 and failure to perform proper unit testing.  Unless you want an open discussion in which we can all learn and grow, I suggest that you implement the most perfect memento pattern in your own work and leave it at that."

This is not a minor issue but the major reason for the existance of the memento patter. The failure of your implementation to meet this requirement followed by your very rude and unprofessional response raises serious concerns about dofactory."
