I\u0027m looking for an approach for a C# solution that dynamically exposing interfaces for a distributed service via a broker.\r\nClient \u003e Broker (or ESB) \u003e Service\r\nWhen a service starts up it automatically registers it\u0027s interface and endpoint with the broker.  All requests from clients go through the broker to make use of service functionality.\r\nAny suggestions gratefully received,\r\nSteve\r\n ",
