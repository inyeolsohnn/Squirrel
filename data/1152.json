  "ques": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am very new to Design Patterns, I have just begun to learn how important it is to get a successful design architecture.\r\nI am facing little problem in starting up with the technology, I don\u0027t know how and where to begin. Should I take up a\r\nsmall Web Development Project and start practicing design pattern on it? Please suggest. \r\n\r\nMaybe I am dumb to ask this here but I hope to get some response.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "ans": "My suggestion would be just take a design pattern and create a program that uses it.  Experiment.  Search the web as well.  There are a lot of design patterns and examples out there.  For me, I just took and example and programmed it.  then played around with it till I got the feel of what it was trying to do.  When you can see what it can do, try and find a project you have already worked and look at where it might fit in and then rework your project with the design pattern.hope this helps you. --- "
