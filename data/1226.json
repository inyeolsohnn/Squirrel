MVC is what is called an architectural pattern while GoF patterns are design patterns.\r\n\r\nHowever, when implementing MVC you can take advantage of existing patterns. Take the Head First Design Patterns book they build MVC using Strategy, Composite, and Observer pattern. And I\u0027m sure that there exists other implementations of the MVC pattern using other design patterns. I have also seen MVC being done using the Command pattern.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, even though MVC is not a GoF pattern, it is still a very useful one. GoF patterns are only a few of all existing patterns out there."
